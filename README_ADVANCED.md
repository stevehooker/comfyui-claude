- **Output Formats**: Plain text, Markdown, JSON, XML
- **Detail Levels**: Concise, Standard, Detailed, Exhaustive
- **Few-shot Learning**: Add example input/output pairs
- **Creativity Control**: Adjust response creativity (0.0-1.0)

#### üñºÔ∏è Context-Aware Describe (Claude)
Multi-image analysis with relationship understanding:
- **Comparison Modes**:
  - Individual: Describe each image separately
  - Comparative: Focus on differences and similarities
  - Sequential: Treat as a sequence or progression
  - Holistic: Describe as parts of a whole
- **Context Preservation**: Use previous descriptions for continuity
- **Focus Elements**: Customizable analysis focus areas

#### ‚ôªÔ∏è Iterative Refine (Claude)
Qwen-inspired iterative improvement system:
- **Refinement Strategies**:
  - Clarify: Improve clarity and understanding
  - Expand: Add relevant details and examples
  - Focus: Make more concise while keeping key info
  - Restructure: Improve organization and flow
  - Enhance Quality: Overall quality improvement
- **Multiple Iterations**: Up to 3 refinement passes
- **Structure Preservation**: Option to maintain original structure
- **Accumulative Improvements**: Build upon previous iterations

#### ‚õìÔ∏è Prompt Chain (Claude)
Chain multiple prompts for complex multi-step processing:
- **3-Step Processing**: Chain up to 3 sequential prompts
- **Flexible Input**: Use text, images, or both
- **Context Passing**: Pass results between steps
- **Combination Modes**:
  - Append: Simple concatenation
  - Synthesize: AI-powered synthesis
  - Extract Key Points: Distill main insights
  - Structured Merge: Formatted combination
